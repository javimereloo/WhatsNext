# What's Next 
Whats next is a simple Flutter app prototype designed to schedule the sending of WhatsApp messages. 

# What is working for the moment
At the moment the application has 3 screens that simulate the aesthetics of the original application:
- Scheduled messages screen
- Screen for scheduling a new message
- Screen with the history of sent messages

It is also able to recognise the contacts of the google account associated with the phone.

</div>

# Features
New functionalities will be added soon to this project:

- Creation of the message sending routine
